## onyx-http

Onyx plugin for http.

#### Installation

In your project file:

```clojure
[org.onyxplatform/onyx-http "0.9.15.1-SNAPSHOT"]
```

In your peer boot-up namespace:

```clojure
(:require [onyx.plugin.http-output])
```

#### Functions

##### http-output

Catalog entry:

```clojure
{:onyx/name :entry-name
 :onyx/plugin :onyx.plugin.http-output/output
 :onyx/type :output
 :onyx/medium :http
 :http-output/success-fn :my.namespace/success?
 :http-output/retry-params {:base-sleep-ms 200
                            :max-sleep-ms 30000
                            :max-total-sleep-ms 3600000}
 :onyx/batch-size batch-size
 :onyx/doc "POST segments to http endpoint"}
```

Segments coming in to your http task are expected in a form such as:
```clojure
{:url "http://localhost:41300/" :args {:body "a=1" :as :json}
```

#### Attributes

|key                           | type      | description
|------------------------------|-----------|------------
|`:http-output/success-fn`     | `keyword` | Accepts response as argument, should return boolean to indicate if the response was successful. Request will be retried in case it wasn't a success.
|`:http-output/retry-params`   | `map`     | Accepts a map of three keys: `:base-sleep-ms` is a delay for a first retry, `:max-sleep-ms` is a maximum retry delay, and `:max-total-sleep-ms` is amount of time when request should be not retried anymore.

##### Batch http-output

The batch http-output plugin will combine a batch's segments into a single http output request.

As the segments can no longer be used for request parameters, these are instead supplied via the task-map. 
A serializer-fn is also provided in case gzip requests need to be made, although :clojure.core/str will generally be used.

```clojure
{:onyx/name :your-task-name
 :onyx/plugin :onyx.plugin.http-output/batch-output
 :onyx/type :output
 :http-output/success-fn ::success?
 :http-output/url "http://localhost:41300/" 
 :http-output/args {:as :json
                    :headers {"content-type" "application/json"
                              "content-encoding" "gzip"}}
 :http-output/serializer-fn ::str->gzip
 ;; Optional basic authentication settings
 ;:http-output/auth-password-env "HTTP_USER_ENV"
 ;:http-output/auth-user-env "HTTP_PASS_ENV"
 :onyx/n-peers 1
 :onyx/medium :http
 :onyx/batch-size 10
 :onyx/batch-timeout 50
 :onyx/doc "Sends http POST requests somewhere"}
```
